# Sample Image Generator

The files in this directory support local demos without relying on external media.  
Run `python samples/generate_sample_images.py` to create simple 1024×768 JPEGs under `backend/static/samples/`.  
Images are procedurally drawn using Pillow and are suitable for fixture listings and Snap-to-Sell previews.  
Generated assets are intended for development only and should not be used in production.*** End Patch** end?** format? apply_patch got weird impetus because we used JSON. It's requiring proper format. need reapply using proper format (no JSON). let's redo with correct apply_patch format.
